            Flipkart is one of India's leading e-commerce companies, known for
            revolutionizing the online shopping experience in the country.
            Founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, Flipkart started
            as an online bookstore and quickly expanded its product range to
            include electronics, fashion, home goods, and much more.
            Headquartered in Bangalore, Flipkart has grown to become a
            significant player in the Indian retail market, offering millions of
            products across various categories. The platform is known for its
            user-friendly interface, wide product selection, competitive
            pricing, and reliable delivery services. Flipkart has also
            introduced several innovative features such as cash on delivery,
            no-cost EMI options, and easy returns to cater to the diverse needs
            of Indian consumers. In 2018, Walmart acquired a majority stake in
            Flipkart, further boosting its market presence and operational
            capabilities. Today, Flipkart continues to be a trusted and popular
            choice for online shopping, serving millions of customers across
